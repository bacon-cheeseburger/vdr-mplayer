The MPlayer plugin is basically a front-end to MPlayer
<http://www.MPlayerHQ.hu/>. You can select a video file from a browser which
then is replayed with MPlayer.

The MPlayer menu:
-----------------

The MPlayer menu is very similar to the the directory browser of the MP3
plugin. You will see the directories and files you created beneath you the base
directory of the current source (how to define sources is explained in "Sources
and playlists" in the MP3 plugin section, but the config file is named
"mplayersources.conf"). The entries surrounded by [ ] are directories. If you
press "ok" on a directory, you will descend to this directory. Press "green" to
return to the parent directory. Use "yellow" to select a different source (see
"The sources menu" in the MP3 plugin section).

Press "red" to start replay of the current file. MPlayer will be started with
this file through a shell script (see README file).

There are two different ways to control MPlayer during replay. The control mode
is selected from the MPlayer plugin setup menu.

The traditional mode:
---------------------

In traditional mode, only "blue" from VDR's remote is active to abort the
replay. No other action is passed to MPlayer. It's up to you to configure
MPlayer to use whatever control device you want (e.g. LIRC, keyboard).

The slave mode:
---------------

In slave mode the MPlayer plugin acts as a control frontend to MPlayer. All
important actions are passed from VDR's remote to MPlayer (see README file on
how to setup your mplayer.sh script for this mode). You can use the following
keys to control playback:

Down        is pause/unpause.

Up          returns to normal replay.

Right/Left  skips back/forward 10 seconds.

Green       skips back 60 seconds.

Yellow      skips forward 60 seconds.

Blue/Back   aborts playback.

Ok          toggles progress display.

0-9         send MPlayer slave command (configurable in plugin setup menu).

In addition the "Volume+","Volume-" and "Mute" keys are routed to MPlayer.

Setup options:
--------------

There are some configuration options which can be changed from the plugin setup
menu. Select VDR's setup menu, select "Plugins" and select "mplayer" to enter
the setup menu.

Control mode:         The MPlayer plugin supports two control modes during
                      replay: traditional and slave (see description above).

Resume mode:          Selects the mode for resuming playback. "local first"
                      means that the plugin first tries to use a resume file in
                      the directory of the video file. Only if this directory is
                      non-writeable the global resume file is used. "global
                      only" will use the global file only and "disabled"
                      disables resume completely.

Slave command key:    Customize the slave commands which are send to MPlayer
                      when the remote keys "0" to "9" are pressed.

Hide main menu entry: Hides the MPlayer menu entry from the main menu.
